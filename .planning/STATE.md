## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Local-first architecture (MMKV + Zustand) for instant feel
- Delayed signup pattern (after baseline test)
- Design-as-you-go in code (no Figma)
- ~10 mock questions sufficient for demo
- XP calculation: 10 base + 2 per consecutive correct (01-02)
- Mixed question proportions: 3 ORD, 2 LÄS, 3 XYZ, 2 KVA (01-02)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MMKV 4.x requires `npx expo prebuild` (exits Expo Go workflow) — validate in Phase 1
- Low-end Android device needed for animation performance testing
