## Gap Closure Verification

All gaps from the first audit (2026-01-27T11:00:00Z) have been closed by Phase 7:

| Gap | First Audit Status | Resolution | Current Status |
|-----|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| OG image flexbox (2013-2017) | CRITICAL — build blocker | Phase 7 Plan 01: display:flex on all divs | CLOSED — build passes 72/72 pages |
| Sitemap missing strategy pages | HIGH — 5 URLs missing | Phase 7 Plan 02: strategyRoutes array added | CLOSED — 34 URLs in sitemap |
| LINK-01: Test → strategy links | HIGH — not implemented | Phase 7 Plan 03: "Lär dig strategier" section | CLOSED — 4 links per test page |
| LINK-02: Strategy → test links | HIGH — only generic link | Phase 7 Plan 03: RecentTests component | CLOSED — 4 specific tests per page |
| Strategy OG images | MEDIUM — not created | Phase 7 Plan 04: 5 opengraph-image.tsx files | CLOSED — all build successfully |
| TODO in types.ts | LOW — outdated comment | Phase 7 Plan 02: DATA SOURCE documentation | CLOSED — accurate docs |

## Remaining Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Phase 3 | Missing VERIFICATION.md (UAT passed 5/6) | Low |

**Total: 1 item** (down from 5 in first audit)

This is non-blocking. Phase 3 work was verified by UAT and further validated by Phase 6's VERIFICATION.md which confirmed all normering infrastructure works correctly.

---

## Build Verification

```
Production build: SUCCESS
Static routes: 72/72 generated
TypeScript errors: 0
Satori/OG image errors: 0

Route breakdown:
- 27 test pages + 27 test OG images
- 5 strategy pages + 5 strategy OG images
- Root + list page + their OG images
- sitemap.xml, robots.txt
```

---

## Verdict

**Status: PASSED**

The v1 milestone is complete. All 21 requirements satisfied, all 7 phases executed, all cross-phase connections wired, all E2E user flows working, and the production build passes cleanly.

**Deliverables summary:**
- SEO infrastructure (sitemap, robots, canonical URLs, metadata, JSON-LD, OG images)
- 26 interactive normering visualizations with accessible table fallbacks
- 4 comprehensive Swedish strategy content pages (3,155 lines total)
