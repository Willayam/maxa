## What This Is

A comprehensive SEO and content enhancement project for Maxa's Hogskoleprovet web app. We're transforming basic test download pages into rich, SEO-optimized study resources with interactive normering (score conversion) visualizations and strategic study content. The goal is to establish topical authority for Hogskoleprovet-related searches through content depth, proper technical SEO, and internal linking.

## Core Value

**Every test page becomes a valuable study resource, not just a download link.** Users find actionable data (normering charts) and strategy insights, while search engines see structured, crawlable content that establishes Maxa as an authority on Hogskoleprovet.

## Requirements

### Validated

- [x] Test listing page at `/hogskoleprovet` with all historical tests — existing
- [x] Test detail pages at `/hogskoleprovet/[slug]` with PDF downloads — existing
- [x] Static site generation for test pages (good for SEO) — existing
- [x] Convex backend for file storage and metadata — existing

- [x] LINK-02: Test page links from strategy pages ("Practice with real tests")
- [x] LINK-03: Related tests section on each test page
- [x] LINK-04: Breadcrumb navigation on all pages

### Out of Scope

- Interactive trap examples/visualizations on strategy pages — complexity, defer to v2
- Video content — different content type, separate initiative
- User accounts/progress tracking — separate feature milestone
- Mobile app content sync — app has different content strategy
- Paid/premium content gating — monetization is separate decision
- A/B testing of content — optimize after baseline established
