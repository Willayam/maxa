# Phase 4 Context: Strategy Content

**Goal:** Users can learn Högskoleprovet strategies through comprehensive Swedish-language content

**Created:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Ready for research

---

## 1. Content Structure

### Hub Page
- **Decision:** Yes, create a hub page linking to all strategy sub-pages
- **Research needed:** Investigate title options with pros/cons for how it fits into the site structure (maxahp.se with existing /hogskoleprovet pages)
- **Research needed:** Investigate grouping options (by test section, by content type, or flat list)
- **Research needed:** Investigate URL structure that works with existing /hogskoleprovet pages

### Navigation Pattern
- **Decision:** Claude decides based on what's best
- **Vision:** "Ultimate guide" anchors that make people think "this is the juice" and want to open 25 tabs within the site
- Core articles as comprehensive anchors that link to sub-pages and articles as content expands

### Internal Linking
- Strategy pages should link extensively to related content within Maxa
- Goal: Create a web of interconnected content that keeps users exploring

---

## 2. Tone & Depth

### Voice
- **Decision:** Mixed tone — authoritative content with friendly energy
- **Audience:** 16-25 year olds
- Use "du-tilltal" throughout (direct, personal address)

### Depth
- **Decision:** Start basic, set the core foundation — can expand later
- Not trying to be comprehensive from day one
- Build the structure that allows for future depth

### Examples
- **Decision:** Claude decides whether to use specific HP test examples or generic examples
- Can reference real tests if it adds credibility and concreteness

---

## 3. Visual Presentation

### Callouts & Boxes
- **Decision:** Claude decides what fits the design system
- Should support scannability

### Diagrams & Illustrations
- **Decision:** Claude decides
- Text-focused initially is acceptable; visuals can come later

### Example Formatting
- **Decision:** Claude decides based on content type
- Options include: before/after, step-by-step breakdown, quick lists

### Summaries (Strong opinion)
- **Decision:** TL;DR at top, section summaries throughout, AND recap at end
- This is a firm requirement — comprehensive summary strategy at all levels

---

## 4. Source Material Handling

### Primary Source
- File: `.context/attachments/Högskoleprovets fällor och strategier-v2.md`
- Comprehensive psykometric analysis covering:
  - Kvantitativa fallor (XYZ, KVA, NOG, DTK)
  - Verbala fallor (ORD, LÄS, MEK, ELF)
  - Vanliga misstag ("The Deadly Dozen")
  - Tidsstrategi

### Transformation Approach
- **Decision:** Cherry-pick the best examples and tables from source
- Build fresh structure around them for "ultimate guide" vision
- Fill gaps with additional research

### Attribution
- **Decision:** Original Maxa content — no explicit citations in content
- **Allowed links:** Official HP resources (studera.nu, universities), academic papers
- **Forbidden links:** Competitor sites (MittHP, HPAkademin, HPspelet, etc.)

## 5. Scope Boundaries

### In Scope (Phase 4)
1. Kvantitativa fallor page — traps in XYZ, KVA, NOG, DTK
2. Verbala fallor page — traps in ORD, LÄS, MEK, ELF
3. Vanliga misstag page — common strategic/behavioral mistakes
4. Tidsstrategi page — time management and pacing

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Interactive practice exercises
- Video content
- Deep-dive sub-articles for each delprov
- User-generated content or comments

---

## 6. Research Directives

The researcher should investigate:

1. **Hub page title options** — What should the main strategy hub be called? Options with pros/cons for Swedish HP SEO
2. **URL structure** — How should strategy URLs fit with existing /hogskoleprovet structure on maxahp.se?
3. **Content grouping** — How to organize the 4 pages within the hub? By test section, content type, or flat?
4. **Supplementary examples** — Additional trap examples and strategies beyond the source document
5. **Swedish HP-specific patterns** — Any unique Swedish testing patterns not in the source

---

## 7. Key Constraints

- Swedish language throughout
- Mobile-first reading experience
- Must work with existing Maxa design system (Duolingo-inspired, bold typography, 2px borders)
- No competitor links
- TL;DR pattern at all content levels
