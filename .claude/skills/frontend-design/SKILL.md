# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. It implements real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

**User Context**: The user provides frontend requirements—a component, page, application, or interface to build—along with context about purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

---

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic direction:
   - Brutally minimal
   - Maximalist chaos
   - Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural
   - Luxury/refined
   - Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine
   - Brutalist/raw
   - Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel
   - Industrial/utilitarian

   Design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.

3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).

4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

### Critical Principle
Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. **Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.**

### Implementation Requirements
Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- ✅ Production-grade and functional
- ✅ Visually striking and memorable
- ✅ Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- ✅ Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Focus Areas

**Typography**
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter
- Opt for distinctive, characterful choices that elevate aesthetics
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

**Color & Theme**
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes

**Motion**
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

**Spatial Composition**
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

**Backgrounds & Visual Details**
- Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors
- Add contextual effects and textures matching the overall aesthetic
- Apply creative forms: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

### What NOT to Do

❌ **NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics:**
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

### Design Principles

- **Interpret creatively** and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for context
- **No design should be the same**—vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics
- **NEVER converge on common choices** (e.g., Space Grotesk) across generations

### Implementation Complexity

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- **Maximalist designs** need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist/refined designs** need restraint, precision, careful spacing, typography, and subtle details
- **Elegance comes from executing the vision well**
