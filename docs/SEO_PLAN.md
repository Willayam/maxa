# Maxa HP: Strategic SEO Roadmap and Content Architecture

> [!NOTE]
> This document establishes the definitive strategy for 'Maxa HP' organic acquisition. It prioritizes data-backed authority (E-E-A-T) combined with a tone that resonates with the Swedish student demographic (16-25 year olds).

## 1. Tactical Positioning: The 80/20 Rule
Our strategy relies on the Pareto Principle. 80% of high-converting organic traffic is driven by:
- **Admission Statistics**: For elite programs (Medicine, Law, Engineering).
- **Practice Material**: Stable links and explanations for old exams.
- **ROI Data**: Connecting study effort to future salary and career impact.

## 2. Tone & Voice Architecture
To effectively reach our **16-25 target audience**, all content must follow these guidelines:
- **Approachable Authority**: Be the "smart older sibling" who knows the shortcuts.
- **Data over Fluff**: Use hard numbers (admission cutoffs, salary stats) to prove points.
- **Empathetic Engagement**: Acknowledge the high-stakes anxiety without being alarmist.
- **Modern Swedish**: Avoid bureaucratic "UHR-speak." Use clear, contemporary Swedish (e.g., "HP-kvoten" instead of "urvalsgruppen för högskoleprovet" when appropriate).

## 3. Technical SEO & Semantic Architecture
The URL structure is strictly hierarchical to build cumulative topical authority.

| Page Type | Recommended URL Pattern | Strategic Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stats Hub** | `/antagningsstatistik/` | Parent for all data/program pages. |
| **Program Specific**| `/antagningsstatistik/[program]/` | Targets high-volume intent (e.g., `/lakarprogrammet/`). |
| **Exam Hub** | `/gamla-hogskoleprov/` | Optimized for "download" and "practice" intent. |
| **Norming** | `/normeringstabeller/` | The calculation utility hub; high dwell time potential. |
| **Career ROI** | `/lonestatistik/` | The motivation hub; converts "dreamers" into "doers." |

### Hub-and-Spoke Internal Linking
- **The Motivation Loop**: Salary stats link to Admission stats. ("Is this degree worth the effort?")
- **The Authority Loop**: Admission stats link to Exam & Tips. ("How do I get the score for this degree?")

## 4. The Five "Power Pages" (Content Pillars)

### Pillar 1: Antagningsstatistik (The Traffic Magnet)
Focus on the "Big Four" degrees: **Medicine, Law, Engineering (Civilingenjör), and Psychology**.

- **Deep Dives**: Provide historical context (HT vs VT variance) and "rejection volume" stats.
- **Insight Example**: Highlight that Lund's Indek (1.75) is often harder than KTH (1.70), building trust through counter-intuitive data.

### Pillar 2: Gamla Högskoleprov (The Utility Magnet)
- **Problem**: Official sources often have broken links or dry PDFs.
- **Solution**: Curated, stable links + **The Value Gap**.
- **Value Gap**: Provide *detailed solutions* (explanations), not just the answer key. This is a massive lead generation opportunity.

### Pillar 3: Normeringstabeller & Calculator
- **Mechanism**: Explain the difference between raw points and normed scores (0.00–2.00).
- **Calculator**: Use a visual tool or comparison table for recent years (HT2025, VT2025) to manage user expectations.

### Pillar 4: Strategic Study Hub (Tips & Strategier)
Break down the 8 sub-tests (XYZ, KVA, NOG, DTK, ORD, LÄS, ELF, MEK).
- **Quick Gains**: Focus on Math (XYZ/KVA) where rapid score jumps are possible.
- **Long-term Habit**: Frame Verbal (ORD/LÄS) as a reading volume game.

### Pillar 5: Career & ROI Guide (The "Why?")
Connect the pain of studying to the pleasure of future earnings.
- **Academic Premium**: Showcase the ~17% lifetime salary gap between academics and non-academics.
- **Gender Gap Insights**: Position the HP as a tool for financial empowerment and transparent pay scales (especially in Medicine).

- Internal link optimization: "Salary -> Admission -> Practice".

### Phase 3: Interactive (Days 60–90)

## 6. Traffic Drivers & Off-Page
- **Forum Engagement**: Reddit (r/sweden) and Flashback. Provide value/data, don't just spam.
- **Cyclical Content**: Align with UHR registration windows (Jan 7-14, Aug 11-18) and exam days.
- **Competitor Gaps**: Offer better free data than the paywalled incumbents (Allakando, HP-portalen).
